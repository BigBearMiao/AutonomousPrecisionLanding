# AutonomousPrecisionLanding
This is a project built for the [Mohammad Bin Zayed International Robotics Competition](http://mbzirc.com/).

This repository contains the code required for precision landing on a moving target. The code base is split into three parts. 
+ Part 1 is Searching where the drone scans the area for the target. 
+ Part 2 is Tracking where the drone tracks its movements. 
+ Part 3 is Landing where the drone lands accurately on the target.

# How to run

1. Open terminal installed with Python 2.7
2. Install the dependencies dronekit and python-opencv
3. Run the code with python Main.py
